    <h3>The Original Donair from the East Coast of Canada</h3>
    <p>In the early 70's, a Greek restaurateur in the city of Halifax 
        introduced the Donair. Within a few short years, virtually all 
        pizzerias had added their version of the dish to their menus. 
        Not to be confused with gyros, the Donair has a vastly different 
        flavor.</p>
    <p>Originally the dish was made with ground lamb, but this proved too 
        costly and ground beef was later substituted. Technically, this 
        resulted in an aberration of sorts, as the final product was not
         what the originator had intended. What resulted, however, is the 
         legendary East Coast Donair.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
           <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
           <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
           <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
           <li>¼ cup white vinegar, or to taste</li>
           <li>6 large pita bread rounds</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, thoroughly mix together the ground beef, black 
                pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, paprika, cayenne 
                pepper, and oregano. Pack the spiced meat into a thick loaf 
                shape, cover, and let rest in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place the meat loaf onto a baking sheet, and bake for 1 
                hour, flipping the loaf over halfway through cooking. Allow
                 the meat loaf to cool so it holds together for slicing.</li>
            <li>Mix together the evaporated milk and white sugar in a bowl, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and then add the vinegar by teaspoons, mixing together after each addition, to taste. Refrigerate the sauce until serving.</li>
            <li>Slice the meat loaf into 1/4-inch thick slices, and brown the slices in a skillet over medium heat until both sides are brown and crisp, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the pita bread rounds with a little water, and press each onto a heated skillet to warm up.</li>
            <li>To serve, place several slices of meat into a warmed pita bread, and spoon about 2 tablespoons of sauce over the meat. Roll the pita bread into a cone shape, wrap in aluminum foil to keep the sauce from dripping out, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
