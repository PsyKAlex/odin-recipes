    <h3>The best Chicken Burger in town!</h3>
    <p>Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce 
        we're having these for dinner. While my husband and I eat 1 or 2 each,
         she easily finishes at least 3! The onion can be finely chopped, but 
         with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it.</p>
    <p>I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a 
        very comforting meal! Extra-lean ground chicken can be substituted 
        with ground turkey with great results.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound extra-lean ground chicken</li>
            <li>½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
            <li>½ small onion, finely grated</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix ground chicken, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, onion, egg, 
                garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Moisten hands 
                and shape chicken mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, into 
                flat, oval-shaped patties.</li>
            <li>Spread remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs into a shallow dish. 
                Roll patties in bread crumbs to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook patties in hot oil until deep brown in color on the 
                bottom, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn patties and cook until other 
                side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
