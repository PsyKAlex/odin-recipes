    <h3>This is a faster, and less expensive lasagna.</h3>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed
       a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well.
       It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for
       lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's 
       original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved 
       it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; 
                drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large 
                skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season with 
                salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic 
                and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; 
                stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, 
                meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is 
                melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
